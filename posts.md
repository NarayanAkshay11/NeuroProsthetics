# Kick Start - Aarambikalaama

Date: July 18, 2024

Our team finally seems to be moving from a small pair of 3 to a faceless mass of 3. Looking at the requirements, it might even go upto 7. But I'd rather outsource work or take favours rather than continuously adding people to this route to success. We came up with the plan for a MVP which we can present to our investors. Today is also the day when I created this website. And, for the ones interested, I'm Akshay, CE Sophomore, really looking forward to do something meaningful and mint money ASAP.

I plan to use this blog as a manner to communicate and start a community of brilliant minds to collaborate. If you wish to contact me, do fill the form in this website (Contact).
